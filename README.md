# Virtual Assistant for Real Estate

A comprehensive VR-enabled real estate solution that combines immersive virtual house tours with an intelligent voice assistant to enhance property viewing and customer interaction experiences.


## Project Overview

This project creates an innovative real estate platform that integrates:
- **VR House Models** - Immersive virtual property tours
- **Voice Assistant** - AI-powered conversational interface for property inquiries
- **3D Character Avatar** - Visual representation of the voice assistant with facial expressions and lip sync

## Features

## Data

The project utilizes a comprehensive real estate dataset containing:
- **13,034 property listings**
- **24 data columns** including:
  - Property ID, Location, Price
  - Property Type (House/Flat)
  - Area, Bedrooms, Bathrooms
  - Geographic coordinates (Latitude/Longitude)
  - Agent and Agency information
  - Price per square foot calculations

### Sample Data Structure
```
Property ID: 237062
Location: G-10, Islamabad  
Price: PKR 10,000,000
Type: Flat (2 bed, 2 bath)
Area: 4 Marla (1,089 sqft)
```


## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Unity 3D (2021.3 LTS or later)
- Python 3.8+
- VR headset (optional, VR simulator available)
- Blender 3.0+ (for 3D model editing)

### Voice Assistant Setup
```bash
pip install numpy faiss-cpu pyttsx3 SpeechRecognition
pip install sentence-transformers groq
```

### Environment Variables
```bash
export GROQ_API_KEY="your_groq_api_key"
```

## Usage

1. **Launch VR Environment**
   - Open Unity project
   - Build and run VR scene
   - Use VR headset or device simulator

2. **Start Voice Assistant**
   ```bash
   python voice_assistant.py
   ```

3. **Interact with System**
   - Navigate virtual property using VR controls
   - Ask questions about properties using voice
   - Receive responses from 3D character avatar

## Future Enhancements

- Multi-language support
- Advanced property filtering
- Integration with real estate APIs
- Mobile VR compatibility
- Cloud deployment options
- Machine learning property recommendations
